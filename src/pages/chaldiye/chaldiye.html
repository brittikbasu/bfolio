      <h1>Key Responsibilities</h1>

  <p>Interaction design | Usability Testing | Information architecture | front end development </p>

    <h1>The Experience</h1>
    <p>For huntfactor I designed the UX and propelled the startup towards the prototype stage. We had a team on the ground (Manali, India) which gathered data and did interviews with prospective users as well as adventure tour operators. I built the personas and wireframes based on this data and then finally designed a high fidelity mobile first responsive app using the ionic framework. I worked closely with the back-end developers and made time saving technical suggestions like using back-end as a service rather than building our own backend. It was my first experience working remotely with such highly passionate people from different backgrounds.</p>
