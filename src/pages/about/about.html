   I'm good at understanding and then communicating this understanding in a way that let's us conceptualize features that your users need. Coming from the startup world I know how important it is to design UX in a way that makes business sense and ticks your KPI's. There has to be a balance. First comes love and then comes money. A delightful UX makes your users fall in love with your app and then monetization becomes easier. I'd love to be the catalyst to your app's success..

   I'm good at understanding problems and then communicating this understanding in a way that let's us conceptualize features that your users need.
   Coming from the startup world I know how important it is to design UX in a way that makes business sense and ticks your KPI's.
   There has to be a balance. First comes love and then comes money.
   A delightful UX makes your users fall in love with your app<!-- and then monetization becomes easier.
   It's all about serving value to users that's easy to use or intuitive. This keeps them coming back.
